    If you are here, you probably know what you are doing.
    
    Hetzner API Key
    THE EASIEST WAY: is to get a hetzner API Key.
    
    Terraform
    We have a end-to-end script that boots up a master and x worker nodes, according to your processing needs.
    The API Key sets up a the worker nodes via Terraform and install K3s.
    The maschines connect and form a cluster that runs the stack. We also provide a few management scripts to handle and setup the cluster.
    We suggest using tooling like K9s along our scripts to install and manage and scale the cluster.
