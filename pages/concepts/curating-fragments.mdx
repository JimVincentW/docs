title: "Curating Annotations"
description: "Turn analysis results into persistent document metadata"
---

Annotations are scoped to a run. \
Curating them makes them permanent qualities of our data.

Curated results become **persistent fragments** - metadata pinned to the asset. Subsequent runs see them as context.

    - Temporary analysis results
    - Tied to a specific schema run
    - Can be deleted or re-run
    - Not visible to subsequent analysis
  </Card>
  <Card title="Persistent Fragments" icon="bookmark">
    - Permanent asset metadata
    - Survives schema changes
    - Included in future analysis context
    - Builds cumulative knowledge
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How to

From the results table of a run dashboard:

1. **Review the extraction** - Check it's accurate and useful, set filters
2. **Click "Curate"** - Converts annotations to persistent fragments
4. **Confirm** - Fragment is now attached to the asset (see above)
