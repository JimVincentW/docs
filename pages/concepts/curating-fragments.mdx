title: "Curating & Promoting Fragments"
description: "Turn analysis results into persistent document metadata"
---

Schema results are **annotations** - they sit alongside your assets but aren't part of the asset itself. If you want an extraction to become a permanent feature of the document, you can **promote** it.

## What Are Persistent Fragments?

When you curate or promote a result, it becomes a **persistent fragment** - a special metadata field attached to the asset. These fragments get included when you run further analysis, so the AI sees them as context.

    - Temporary analysis results
    - Tied to a specific schema run
    - Can be deleted or re-run
    - Not visible to subsequent analysis

    - Permanent asset metadata
    - Survives schema changes
    - Included in future analysis context
    - Builds cumulative knowledge

## Why Promote Results?

This is useful for building up knowledge incrementally:

<Steps>
<Step title="Run initial extraction">
Apply a schema to extract key claims, entities, or summaries
</Step>
<Step title="Review results">
Check quality, identify good extractions
</Step>
<Step title="Promote the good ones">
Convert accurate results to persistent fragments
</Step>
<Step title="Run deeper analysis">
Subsequent schemas now see those fragments as context
</Step>
<Step title="Extract relationships">
Find contradictions, connections, or patterns that depend on the first pass
</Step>
</Steps>

## Example Workflow

**Pass 1: Entity Extraction**
- Run schema to extract people, organisations, locations
- Review results, promote verified entities as fragments

**Pass 2: Relationship Analysis**
- Run second schema asking "what relationships exist between entities?"
- The AI now sees the promoted entities as part of the document context
- Extracts relationships with better accuracy

**Pass 3: Claim Verification**
- Run third schema to identify claims about those entities
- Cross-reference with known facts
- Build a knowledge graph incrementally

## Promoting Results

From the annotation results view:

1. **Review the extraction** - Check it's accurate and useful
2. **Click "Promote"** - Converts to persistent fragment
3. **Optionally edit** - Refine the value before saving
4. **Confirm** - Fragment is now attached to the asset

Promoted extractions become durable. They survive re-runs and inform future analysis.

## Managing Fragments

View and manage fragments on any asset:
- See all attached fragments
- Edit fragment values
- Remove fragments you no longer need
- See which schema run originally created them
