title: "Curating & Promoting Fragments"
description: "Turn analysis results into persistent document metadata"

Schema results are **annotations** - they sit alongside your assets but aren't part of the asset itself. If you want an extraction to become a permanent feature of the document, you can **promote** it.

## What Are Persistent Fragments?

When you curate or promote a result, it becomes a **persistent fragment** - a special metadata field attached to the asset. These fragments get included when you run further analysis, so the AI sees them as context.

## Why Promote Results?

This is useful for building up knowledge incrementally, but also one time tagging and sorting of your

<Step title="Run initial extraction">
Apply a schema to extract key claims, entities, or summaries
</Step>
<Step title="Review results">
Check quality, identify good extractions
</Step>
<Step title="Promote the good ones">
Convert accurate results to persistent fragments
</Step>
<Step title="Run deeper analysis">
Subsequent schemas now see those fragments as context
</Step>
<Step title="Extract relationships">
Find contradictions, connections, or patterns that depend on the first pass
</Step>
</Steps>

## Promoting Results

From the results table of a run dashboard:

1. **Review the extraction** - Check it's accurate and useful
2. **Click "Promote"** - Converts annotations to persistent fragments
4. **Confirm** - Fragment is now attached to the asset


## Managing Fragments

View and manage fragments on any asset:
- See all attached fragments
- Remove fragments you no longer need
- See which schema run originally created them
