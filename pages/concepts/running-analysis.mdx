description: "Apply schemas to your documents and extract structured data"

Once you have a schema and some assets, you can run analysis. Each document gets processed by your chosen model, and results are stored as structured annotations.

## The Process

<Steps>
<Step title="Select content">
Pick individual assets or entire bundles
</Step>
<Step title="Choose schema">
Select which schema to apply
</Step>
<Step title="Pick model">
OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or local via Ollama
</Step>
<Step title="Run">
Each document gets processed, results stored as structured JSON
</Step>
</Steps>

## Choosing a Model

Different models have different strengths:

| Provider | Best for | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **OpenAI** | General extraction, high throughput | Reliable, fast, good default |
| **Anthropic** | Nuanced analysis, long documents | Better at complex reasoning |
| **Google** | Large context windows | Good for lengthy documents |
| **Ollama** | Privacy, local processing | No data leaves your machine |

## Batch Processing

<Note> When analysing large collections </Note>

1. **Start small** - Test on 2-3 documents first
2. **Check outputs** - Do they match expectations?
3. **Refine instructions** - Tighten schema if needed
4. **Scale up** - Run on full collection


## Monitoring Runs

Active analysis runs show progress in the UI:
- Documents processed / total
- Current status (running, completed, failed)
- Error details if something goes wrong

Failed documents can be retried individually without re-running the entire batch.

## Results

After analysis completes, results appear as **annotations** on your assets. Each annotation contains the structured data your schema extracted.

View results:
- **On the asset** - See all annotations for a specific document
- **Fragments** - If curated from a table, you can see the persistent fragments on the asset detail view
- **In dashboards** - Aggregate and visualise across the entire run
- **Via export** - Download as CSV or JSON for external analysis
