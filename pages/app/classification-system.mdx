# Classification System

> Creating and applying analytical frameworks to political content

## What Is the Classification System?

The Classification System lets you define analytical concepts in plain language and apply them systematically across political content. This bridges the gap between qualitative and quantitative analysis.

**Example:** A policy analyst creates a framework to analyse legislative proposals:

```
For each proposal, extract:
- Policy area: [healthcare, environment, economy, security]
- Stakeholder engagement: [consultation, public input, expert review, none]
- Implementation timeline: [immediate, 1-year, 2-5 years, undefined]
- Budget impact: [no cost, low cost, moderate cost, high cost]
```

Result: Systematic analysis of 500 proposals revealing patterns in stakeholder involvement and implementation planning.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Define Your Framework

<Card title="Create Analytical Dimensions" icon="cog">
- Choose data types (text, number, list, etc.)
- Write clear descriptions of what you're looking for
- Add examples or edge cases for clarity
- Test your framework on sample content
</Card>

**Example Framework:**
```
Political Position Analysis:
- Economic stance (1-10): Where 1 is extremely progressive and 10 is extremely conservative on economic issues
- Social stance (1-10): Where 1 is extremely progressive and 10 is extremely conservative on social issues
- Foreign policy approach (text): Brief description of the foreign policy approach (isolationist, interventionist, multilateral, etc.)
- Key policies (list): The 3-5 main policy positions mentioned
```

### Step 2: Apply to Content

  <Card title="Select Your Documents" icon="folder">
    - Choose from uploaded content
    - Filter by source, date, or other criteria
    - Start with a small sample to test your framework
    - Scale up once you're confident in the results

  </Card>
  <Card title="Analyze Patterns" icon="chart-line">
    - Identify trends and relationships
    - Compare results across different sources
    - Find outliers and unusual cases
    - Generate insights and conclusions

## Example Frameworks

### Political Positioning Analysis

**Framework:**
```
Schema: Political Position Analysis

Dimensions:
- economic_position (1-10): Where 1 is extremely progressive and 10 is extremely conservative on economic issues
- social_position (1-10): Where 1 is extremely progressive and 10 is extremely conservative on social issues
- foreign_policy_approach (text): Brief description of the foreign policy approach (isolationist, interventionist, multilateral, etc.)
- key_policies (list): The 3-5 main policy positions mentioned
```

**Use Cases:**
- Analyze political speeches and statements
- Compare positions across different politicians
- Track position changes over time
- Identify coalition opportunities

### Issue Framing Analysis

**Framework:**
```
Schema: Issue Framing Analysis

Dimensions:
- economic_frame (0.0-1.0): Extent to which the issue is framed in economic terms
- security_frame (0.0-1.0): Extent to which the issue is framed as a security concern
- moral_frame (0.0-1.0): Extent to which the issue is framed as a moral question
- primary_frame (text): The dominant framing approach used
- supporting_evidence (list): Specific evidence cited to support the framing
```

**Use Cases:**
- Analyze media coverage of political issues
- Compare framing across different sources
- Identify dominant narratives
- Track framing changes over time

### Rhetorical Strategy Analysis

**Framework:**
```
Schema: Rhetorical Strategy Analysis

Dimensions:
- emotional_appeal (0.0-1.0): Extent of emotional language and appeals
- factual_content (0.0-1.0): Degree of fact-based argumentation
- authority_citation (list): Sources of authority referenced
- narrative_techniques (list): Storytelling techniques employed
- primary_audience (text): Who appears to be the intended audience
```

**Use Cases:**
- Analyze political communication strategies
- Compare rhetorical approaches across speakers
- Identify effective messaging techniques
- Study audience targeting strategies

## Creating Effective Frameworks

### Be Specific and Clear

**Good Instructions:**
```
Evaluate the extent to which the text frames immigration in economic terms (jobs, taxes, fiscal impact) versus security terms (border control, crime, terrorism).
```

**Avoid Vague Instructions:**
```
Analyze how the text talks about immigration.
```

### Use Appropriate Data Types

**Choose the Right Type:**
- **Numbers (int/float)** — For ratings, scales, or percentages
- **Text (string)** — For categories, descriptions, or primary characteristics
- **Lists** — For multiple items, themes, or examples
- **Structured objects** — For complex information with sub-components

### Provide Context

**Help the System Understand:**
```
In the context of European politics, identify the policy positions that would be considered center-left versus center-right on economic issues.
```

**Avoid Ambiguous Context:**
```
Identify left vs right positions.
```

### Consider Scale Definitions

**Define What Different Values Mean:**
```
Rate from 1-5, where 1 means strongly opposed to international cooperation, 3 means neutral or mixed, and 5 means strongly favoring international institutions and agreements.
```

**Avoid Unclear Scales:**
```
Rate international cooperation from 1-5.
```
