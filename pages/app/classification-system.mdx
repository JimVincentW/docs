description: 'Creating and applying analytical frameworks to political content'
---

The Classification System lets you define analytical concepts in plain language and apply them systematically across political content. This powerful tool bridges the gap between qualitative and quantitative analysis.

## What You Can Do

With the Classification System, you can:

- Create frameworks that extract structured information from political texts
- Define multiple analytical dimensions to capture complex concepts
- Apply your frameworks consistently across large document collections
- Analyze and visualize patterns in the resulting data

This approach enables sophisticated analysis without requiring programming skills.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the Classification Runner">
    From your dashboard, click on the "Classification" section in the navigation menu.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/classification_menu.png" alt="Classification Menu" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select or Create a Schema">
    You can choose an existing analytical framework or create a new one:
    
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Use Existing Schema">
        Browse the schema library for frameworks like:
        - Topic classification
        - Sentiment analysis
        - Policy position analysis
        - Rhetorical strategy detection
      </Tab>
      
      <Tab title="Create New Schema">
        Click "Create Schema" and provide:
        - Name for your framework
        - Description of its purpose
        - The dimensions you want to analyze
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Define Your Dimensions">
    For each dimension in your schema:
    
    1. Select the data type (number, text, list, etc.)
    2. Write a clear description of what you're looking for
    3. Optionally add examples or edge cases
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/dimension_definition.png" alt="Dimension Definition" />
    </Frame>
    
    <Tip>
      The better your descriptions, the more consistent your results will be. Be specific and provide context.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Content">
    Choose which documents to analyze:
    
    - Search results
    - Saved collections
    - Recent news
    - Uploaded documents
    
    <Note>
      For large document sets, consider starting with a small sample to test your schema.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run the Classification">
    Click "Run Analysis" to apply your schema to the selected documents.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/classification_progress.png" alt="Classification Progress" />
    </Frame>
    
    The system will:
    1. Process each document
    2. Extract information according to your schema
    3. Store the structured results
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Explore Results">
    When processing completes, you can:
    
    - View results in table format
    - Create visualizations
    - Export data for further analysis
    - Share insights with others

## Example Schemas

Here are some example schemas to help you get started:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Political Positioning">
    ```
    Schema: Political Position Analysis
    
    Dimensions:
    - economic_position (1-10): Where 1 is extremely progressive and 10 is extremely conservative on economic issues
    - social_position (1-10): Where 1 is extremely progressive and 10 is extremely conservative on social issues
    - foreign_policy_approach (text): Brief description of the foreign policy approach (isolationist, interventionist, multilateral, etc.)
    - key_policies (list): The 3-5 main policy positions mentioned
    ```
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/political_position_chart.png" alt="Political Position Chart" />
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Issue Framing">
    ```
    Schema: Issue Framing Analysis
    
    Dimensions:
    - economic_frame (0.0-1.0): Extent to which the issue is framed in economic terms
    - security_frame (0.0-1.0): Extent to which the issue is framed as a security concern
    - moral_frame (0.0-1.0): Extent to which the issue is framed as a moral question
    - primary_frame (text): The dominant framing approach used
    - supporting_evidence (list): Specific evidence cited to support the framing
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Rhetoric Analysis">
    ```
    Schema: Rhetorical Strategy Analysis
    
    Dimensions:
    - emotional_appeal (0.0-1.0): Extent of emotional language and appeals
    - factual_content (0.0-1.0): Degree of fact-based argumentation
    - authority_citation (list): Sources of authority referenced
    - narrative_techniques (list): Storytelling techniques employed
    - primary_audience (text): Who appears to be the intended audience
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Creating Effective Schemas

For best results, follow these guidelines when creating your analytical frameworks:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific and Clear">
    Define exactly what you're looking for in plain language. Avoid vague terms that could be interpreted differently.
    
    <Check>
      "Evaluate the extent to which the text frames immigration in economic terms (jobs, taxes, fiscal impact) versus security terms (border control, crime, terrorism)."
    </Check>
    
    <Cross>
      "Analyze how the text talks about immigration."
    </Cross>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Appropriate Data Types">
    Choose the right type for each dimension:
    
    - **Numbers (int/float)**: For ratings, scales, or percentages
    - **Text (string)**: For categories, descriptions, or primary characteristics
    - **Lists**: For multiple items, themes, or examples
    - **Structured objects**: For complex information with sub-components
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Provide Context">
    Help the system understand the political context relevant to your analysis:
    
    <Check>
      "In the context of European politics, identify the policy positions that would be considered center-left versus center-right on economic issues."
    </Check>
    
    <Cross>
      "Identify left vs right positions."
    </Cross>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Consider Scale Definitions">
    When using numerical scales, clearly define what different values represent:
    
    <Check>
      "Rate from 1-5, where 1 means strongly opposed to international cooperation, 3 means neutral or mixed, and 5 means strongly favoring international institutions and agreements."
    </Check>
    
    <Cross>
      "Rate international cooperation from 1-5."
    </Cross>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Working with Results

After running a classification, you have several options for working with the results:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Table View" icon="table">
    View all dimensions across your documents in a sortable, filterable table
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Visualizations" icon="chart-bar">
    Create charts and graphs to identify patterns and relationships
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Globe Mapping" icon="earth-americas">
    View results geospatially when content has location information
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Export" icon="file-export">
    Download results as CSV, JSON, or Excel for external analysis
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Filtering and Refining

You can filter your results to focus on specific aspects:

- Filter by dimension values (e.g., economic position > 7)
- Filter by source, date, or other metadata
- Create subsets for more detailed analysis

### Comparing Frameworks

A powerful feature is the ability to apply different analytical frameworks to the same content:

1. Run multiple schemas on the same document set
2. Compare how different analytical approaches reveal different patterns
3. Identify areas of consensus and divergence

This can reveal how analytical choices influence results, promoting methodological transparency.

## Technical Details

Behind the user interface, the Classification System uses:

- Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret your analytical frameworks
- Structured data types for consistent results
- Validation to ensure outputs match expected formats
- Comprehensive metadata tracking for reproducibility

For more technical information, see the [LLM Classification Framework](/engine/classification-framework) documentation.
