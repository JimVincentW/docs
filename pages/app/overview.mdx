We aim to provide few but powerful core concepts to allow for flexible data ingestion, analysis and management.
Foundation services like AI Models, a Geocoder or a Websearch tool can extend the functionality and allow for hybrid setups. From cloud to fully local on your own hardware.


<Note>Before you start: make sure everything is properly installed and configured. </Note>

## Infospaces - your project spaces
Everything lives inside one - isolated from other projects, each its own vector index for semantic search.

## Analysis
This is where it all comes together. With the building blocks above you are set to work through your data by configuring an analysis.

[1. Configure an analysis run](/pages/concepts/running-analysis)
What questions do you want to answer? What data do you have? 
Also set up parametrs like parallelisation and if you want justifications for fields.

</Card>
<Card title="2. Explore, Share and Work with the run's Dashboard" icon="chart-line" href="/pages/app/dashboards">
Your results. Tables, charts, maps. Export or share. Every run produces structured data. Or as we call them: <span className="font-bold">annotations</span>.

<img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/dashboard-speeches-light.png" alt="Dashboard" width="100%" />
</Card>
</CardGroup>
Once it's done, we can start to explore the results. We can filter, sort, visualise, share, curate and export the resulting data.


## Chat & Tools

<Card title="Chat" icon="comments" href="/pages/app/chat">
Your data management interface. Query, build schemas, run analysis, explore, find similar items. Deduplicate and synthesise - through dialogue.
