## What Are Infospaces?

Each infospace is a separate information environment - your assets, schemas, and analysis results stay isolated. Think of them as separate research projects, departments, or clients.

## Managing Infospaces

### Creating and Switching

**Default Infospace:**
You start with "Default Infospace" containing example assets and schemas to help you get started.

- Choose a descriptive name for your project
- Set up initial bundles and schemas

**Managing Existing Infospaces:**
- Select "Manage Infospaces" to rename or delete
- Archive old projects to keep your workspace clean
- Export infospace data for backup or sharing
- Import infospace configurations from other users

## Vector Storage & Search

Every infospace is also a [vector store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_database). Your documents get embedded - enabling semantic search, similarity matching and better tooling for your LLM model to work with.

    When you enable vectorisation in your infospace settings:
    - Background task creates vectors for all content
    - Continuous processing of new uploads
    - Automatic updates when content changes

  <Card title="Similarity Search" icon="search">
    - Find documents with similar content or themes
