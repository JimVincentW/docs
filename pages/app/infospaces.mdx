# Infospaces & Vector Storage

> Isolated workspaces to organise your project data

## What Are Infospaces?

Infospaces are separate workspaces that isolate your data. Each infospace contains its own assets, schemas, analysis results, and configurations. Think of them as separate research projects or departments.

**Example:** A research organisation might have:
- **"Climate Policy Research"** — Climate-related documents and analysis
- **"Election Coverage 2024"** — News articles and media analysis
- **"Grant Applications"** — Funding requests and review processes
- **"Academic Papers"** — Research literature and methodology

## Managing Infospaces

### Creating and Switching

**Default Infospace:**
You start with "Default Infospace" containing example assets and schemas to help you get started.

**Switching Between Infospaces:**
Use the Infospace Switcher in the top left sidebar to see all your infospaces. Click any infospace to switch to it.

**Creating New Infospaces:**
- Click "Create Infospace" to add a new workspace
- Choose a descriptive name for your project
- Set up initial bundles and schemas
- Configure settings specific to that workspace

**Managing Existing Infospaces:**
- Select "Manage Infospaces" to rename or delete
- Archive old projects to keep your workspace clean
- Export infospace data for backup or sharing
- Import infospace configurations from other users

## Vector Storage & Search

An infospace is also a vectorspace—a collection of vector embeddings that enable semantic search and AI powered analysis.

### Vector Search Capabilities

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Similarity Search" icon="search">
    - Find documents with similar content or themes
    - Discover related research and analysis
    - Identify patterns across different sources
    - Connect disparate pieces of information
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI Context Enhancement" icon="brain">
    - Provide relevant context for AI analysis
    - Improve schema accuracy and relevance
    - Enhance chat interface with document knowledge
    - Enable more sophisticated analysis workflows
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Vectorization Process

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Automatic Vectorization" icon="cog">
    When you enable vectorisation in your infospace settings:
    - Background task creates vectors for all content
    - Continuous processing of new uploads
    - Automatic updates when content changes
    - Quality monitoring and optimisation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Cases" icon="lightbulb">
    - **Deduplication** — Find and merge similar assets
    - **Clustering** — Group related content automatically
    - **Recommendation** — Suggest relevant documents
    - **Knowledge Discovery** — Find hidden connections
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Data Storage & Backups

### Storage Locations

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Self Hosted" icon="server">
    - Data stored locally in `./store/minio`
    - Full control over data location and access
    - No external dependencies for storage
    - Suitable for sensitive or confidential data
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hosted Service" icon="cloud">
    - Data stored in Hetzner Object Storage
    - Managed infrastructure and maintenance
    - Automatic scaling and redundancy
    - Professional backup and recovery services
  </Card>

**Creating Backups:**
1. **Navigate to Backup Settings** in your infospace
2. **Choose Backup Scope** — Full infospace or specific data
3. **Select Backup Destination** — Local storage or cloud
4. **Schedule Regular Backups** — Daily, weekly, or monthly
5. **Monitor Backup Status** — Ensure successful completion

**Backup Types:**
- **Full Backups** — Complete infospace data and configuration
- **Incremental Backups** — Only changed data since last backup
- **Schema Backups** — Analysis frameworks and configurations
- **Asset Backups** — Document content and metadata

**Restoring from Backups:**
1. **Select Backup to Restore** from available backups
2. **Choose Restore Scope** — Full restore or selective data
3. **Verify Data Integrity** — Check restored content
4. **Update Permissions** — Ensure proper access controls
5. **Test Functionality** — Verify all features work correctly

### Data Security

**Access Control:**
- User permissions per infospace
- Role-based access management
