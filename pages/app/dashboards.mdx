**Example:** A policy analyst creates a dashboard showing:
- **Time series chart**: Policy mentions over time
- **Geographic map**: Regional distribution of issues
- **Data table**: Detailed results with filtering
- **Distribution chart**: Topic breakdown by source

## Creating Dashboards

### Default Layout
New analysis runs automatically get a default dashboard with:
- Data table showing all results
- Time series chart of analysis activity
- Distribution chart of schema results

### Custom Panels
Add panels to focus on specific aspects:

**Geographic Panel**: Add a map for location-based analysis
**Knowledge Graph Panel**: Show relationship networks
**Custom Chart Panel**: Focus on specific metrics or trends
**Filtered Table Panel**: Show subset of results with specific criteria

### Panel Configuration
Each panel can be independently configured:

**Filters**: Show only relevant data in each panel
**Display Options**: Customise colours, labels, and formatting
**Interaction Settings**: Enable click through and drill down features
**Update Frequency**: Control how often panels refresh
