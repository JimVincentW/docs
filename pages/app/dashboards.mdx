**Example:** A policy analyst creates a dashboard showing:
- **Time series chart** — Policy mentions over time
- **Geographic map** — Regional distribution of issues
- **Data table** — Detailed results with filtering
- **Distribution chart** — Topic breakdown by source

## Creating Dashboards

### Default Layout
New analysis runs automatically get a default dashboard with:

### Custom Panels
Add panels to focus on specific aspects:

**Geographic Panel** — Add a map for location-based analysis
**Knowledge Graph Panel** — Show relationship networks
**Custom Chart Panel** — Focus on specific metrics or trends
**Filtered Table Panel** — Show subset of results with specific criteria

### Panel Configuration
Each panel can be independently configured:

**Filters** — Show only relevant data in each panel
**Display Options** — Customize colours, labels, and formatting
**Interaction Settings** — Enable click through and drill down features
**Update Frequency** — Control how often panels refresh
