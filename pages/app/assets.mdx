## Asset Relationships & Hierarchy

Open Politics HQ automatically creates relationships between assets to preserve document structure and enable sophisticated analysis workflows.

### Parent-Child Relationships

When processing complex documents, the system creates hierarchical relationships:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="PDF Processing">
  ```
  📄 "Research Report.pdf" (parent)
  ├── 📝 "Page 1" (child, extracted text)
  ├── 📝 "Page 2" (child, extracted text)  
  ├── 📝 "Page 3" (child, extracted text)
  └── 🖼️ "Figure 1" (child, extracted image)
  ```
  
  Each page becomes a separate asset for targeted analysis while maintaining connection to the source document.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Web Article Processing">
  ```
  🌐 "News Article" (parent)
  ├── 🖼️ "Featured Image" (child, role="featured")
  ├── 🖼️ "Chart 1" (child, role="content")
  └── 🖼️ "Photo Gallery" (child, role="content")
  ```
  
  Images are extracted and categorized by their role in the article structure.
</Tab>

<Tab title="CSV Processing">
  ```
  📊 "Survey Data.csv" (parent)
  ├── 📋 "Row 1: Respondent 001" (child)
  ├── 📋 "Row 2: Respondent 002" (child)
  ├── 📋 "Row 3: Respondent 003" (child)
  └── ... (additional rows)
  ```
  
  Each row becomes an individual asset for granular analysis and filtering.
</Tab>
</Tabs>
