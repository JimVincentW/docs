# Assets & Bundles

> Upload and organise your research materials

## What Are Assets?

Assets are individual pieces of content—PDFs, web articles, CSV files, text documents. Each asset becomes a searchable, analysable unit in your workspace.

**Example:** Upload a 50-page government report. System creates:
- **Parent asset:** "Government Report.pdf" 
- **Child assets:** Individual pages for targeted analysis
- **Extracted text:** Searchable content from each page

## Organizing with Bundles

Bundles are collections of related assets—think of them as folders for your research materials.

### Creating Bundles

**Project-Based Organization:**
- "Climate Policy Analysis" — All climate-related documents
- "Election Coverage 2024" — News articles from election period
- "Grant Applications Q1" — Funding requests for review

**Source-Based Organization:**
- "Government Sources" — Official documents and reports
- "News Outlets" — Media coverage and analysis
- "Academic Papers" — Research and studies

**Topic-Based Organization:**
- "Immigration Policy" — All immigration-related content
- "Economic Analysis" — Financial reports and data
- "Social Issues" — Community and social policy content

### Bundle Management

**Nested Structure:**
```
Climate Policy Analysis/
├── Government Reports/
│   ├── IPCC Report 2023.pdf
│   └── National Climate Plan.pdf
├── News Coverage/
│   ├── Guardian Articles/
│   └── Reuters Coverage/
└── Academic Research/
    ├── Climate Science Papers/
    └── Policy Analysis Studies/
```

**Cross References:**
- Assets can belong to multiple bundles
- Create thematic collections without duplicating content
- Maintain relationships between related documents

## Asset Relationships

### Parent-Child Relationships

When processing complex documents, the system creates hierarchical relationships:

**PDF Processing:**
```
📄 "Research Report.pdf" (parent)
├── 📝 "Page 1" (child, extracted text)
├── 📝 "Page 2" (child, extracted text)  
├── 📝 "Page 3" (child, extracted text)
└── 🖼️ "Figure 1" (child, extracted image)
```

Each page becomes a separate asset for targeted analysis while maintaining connection to the source document.

**Web Article Processing:**
```
🌐 "News Article" (parent)
├── 🖼️ "Featured Image" (child, role="featured")
├── 🖼️ "Chart 1" (child, role="content")
└── 🖼️ "Photo Gallery" (child, role="content")
```

Images are extracted and categorised by their role in the article structure.

**CSV Processing:**
```
📊 "Survey Data.csv" (parent)
├── 📋 "Row 1: Respondent 001" (child)
├── 📋 "Row 2: Respondent 002" (child)
├── 📋 "Row 3: Respondent 003" (child)
└── ... (additional rows)
```

Each row becomes an individual asset for granular analysis and filtering.
