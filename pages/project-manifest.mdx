Open Politics is constructing a collaborative platform where political knowledge and analysis tools are freely accessible to all.".

We believe that understanding politics shouldn't require special access, technical expertise, or institutional resources. The tools and methods for making sense of our complex political world should be available to everyone.


## Our Vision

We envision a world where:

- Citizens can navigate complex political information with the same sophistication previously limited to institutions
- Analytical methods are transparent, contestable, and improvable through public discourse
- Different perspectives can be expressed through custom analytical frameworks rather than predetermined categories
- Tools for political understanding are treated as public infrastructure rather than proprietary assets

## What Makes This Different

Traditional approaches to political understanding face a fundamental dilemma: qualitative methods don't scale, while computational methods require technical expertise.

Open Politics bridges this gap by allowing domain experts to define analytical frameworks in plain language while leveraging computational power to apply them at scale.

## Beyond Left and Right

Most political analysis tools force information into predetermined categories—typically along a single left-right spectrum. This flattens the rich complexity of political thought.

Open Politics enables multidimensional analysis where users can:
- Create custom dimensions like "focus on economic policy" or "diplomatic vs. confrontational rhetoric"
- Visualize results across these dimensions
- Share and discuss their frameworks with others

This approach reflects the true complexity of political discourse better than binary classifications.

## Creating Public Tools & Infrastructure

Our approach treats political intelligence tools as public infrastructure rather than proprietary assets. We're building:

- Open source code available to all
- Public methodologies that can be scrutinized and improved
- Shared analytical frameworks as a form of collective intelligence
- Access to our hosted plattform on a BYOC (bring your own compute/ LLM API keys)

Through this open and collaborative approach, we seek to revolutionize how society understands and participates in political discourse.

## Join Us

We invite you to join us in building this new kind of political intelligence infrastructure—one that empowers citizens rather than institutions, values transparency over proprietary methods, and creates space for diverse analytical perspectives.
