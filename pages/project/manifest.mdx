## What We're Building

Open Politics develops open-source tools for political intelligence, democratising access to sophisticated analysis that was previously available only to institutions with specialised resources.

We believe understanding politics shouldn't require special access, technical expertise, or institutional backing. The tools for making sense of our complex political world should be available to everyone.

## Our Vision

We envision a world where:

- Citizens can navigate complex political information with the same sophistication previously limited to institutions
- Analytical methods are transparent, contestable, and improvable through public discourse
- Different perspectives can be expressed through custom analytical frameworks rather than predetermined categories
- Tools for political understanding are treated as public infrastructure rather than proprietary assets

## Our Approach

Traditional approaches to political understanding face a fundamental challenge: qualitative methods don't scale, while computational methods require technical expertise.

Open Politics bridges this gap through several innovations:

  <Card title="User-Defined Frameworks" icon="sliders">
    Define analytical concepts in natural language and apply them systematically across large document collections
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Methodological Transparency" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Make analytical choices explicit and open to scrutiny, enabling discussion about both findings and how those findings were derived

  <Card title="Multidimensional Analysis" icon="cubes">
    Move beyond simplistic left-right classification to explore political information across multiple user-defined dimensions

  <Card title="Cross-Source Integration" icon="shuffle">
    Apply consistent analytical frameworks across diverse sources—news, legislation, economic data, social media, and more
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Beyond Left and Right

Most political analysis tools force information into predetermined categories—typically along a single left-right spectrum. This flattens the rich complexity of political thought.

Open Politics enables multidimensional analysis where users can:
- Create custom dimensions like "focus on economic policy" or "diplomatic vs. confrontational rhetoric"
- Visualise results across these dimensions
- Share and discuss their frameworks with others

This approach reflects the true complexity of political discourse better than binary classifications.

## Creating Public Infrastructure

Our approach treats political intelligence tools as public infrastructure rather than proprietary assets. We're building:

- Open-source code available to all
- Public methodologies that can be scrutinised and improved
- Shared analytical frameworks as a form of collective intelligence
- Accessible hosting options with a "bring your own compute" approach for those who need it

Through this open and collaborative approach, we seek to transform how society understands and participates in political discourse.
