> "Open Source Political Intelligence" - What is that and why do we need it?  
> ðŸŽ¬ [Watch our presentation](https://media.ccc.de/v/dg-111)

Open Politics creates an open-source platform that makes political intelligence accessible to everyone. Our mission is to help citizens navigate complex political information through intuitive tools that gather, analyse, and visualise political data.

We're working to democratise access to the kind of sophisticated political analysis that was previously available only to institutions with specialised resources.


<Note>
  Our platform is currently in late beta. The hosted version will be available for registration soon at [open-politics.org](https://open-politics.org).

## The Challenge

Political information is overwhelming:
- News from countless sources
- Complex legislative procedures
- Evolving conflicts and situations
- Relationships between political actors

Most people lack the time and tools to develop a comprehensive understanding of these interconnected elements. This knowledge gap creates barriers to informed civic engagement.

## Our Solution

Open Politics combines Natural language instruction with classical data science methods to create tools that anyone can useâ€”no technical expertise required.

### Two Core Components

  <Card title="HQ" icon="laptop" img="/images/opol-data-on-globe.png">
    The user interface that makes this information accessible: Interactive globe visualisation, analysis workspaces, classification tools, and search and exploration interfaces.
  </Card>

  <Card title="OPOL" icon="database" img="/images/opol-k8s.png">
    Our data engine that processes political content from diverse sources: Ingests and enriches political data, identifies entities and relationships, applies LLM-based classifications, and enables semantic search.

## Our Approach

We're creating a multifaceted approach to political intelligence that extends beyond any single interface:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Data-Driven Insights" icon="chart-bar">
    We combine diverse data sources with computational analysis to reveal patterns that wouldn't be visible through manual methods.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="User-Defined Frameworks" icon="pencil">
    Users can define what matters to themâ€”custom dimensions of analysis, specific regions of interest, or particular political issuesâ€”rather than being limited to predefined categories.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Accessible Interfaces" icon="universal-access">
    From visualisation options to interface design, we're committed to making political intelligence accessible to people with diverse abilities and needs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Methodological Transparency" icon="eye">
    We make analytical methods explicit and open to scrutiny, enabling discussion not just about findings but about how those findings were derived.
