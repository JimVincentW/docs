## Introduction
Open Politics' vision is to democratise political intelligence. 

The mission is to create an open-source data science and AI toolkit to analyse, summarise, and visualise political information.

<Note>
    There is a preliminary alpha running, we encourage your own experiments with the stack though.
    Please contact us at engage@open-politics.org if you want to request access.

## Why Open Politics Exists
- All things regarding politics, be they news, conflicts or legislative procedures, are hard to keep track of. It's hard to find the time to read through all the documents and news articles necessary to gain a broad and well-informed understanding of political situations. Technology offers great possibilities to make such processes more accessible.   
  Recently, the advent of Large Language Models has extended the capabilities of textual analysis and understanding. Especially the ability to formulate tasks in natural language opens up new possibilities for analysing text data. Potentially revolutionising the way qualitative and quantitative research can be combined.

This project specialises on assembling data, building infrastructure and embedding tools into meaningful user interfaces.

## We generally categorise our work into three pillars
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Aggregating Data & Engineering Insights" icon='brain'>
  For any intelligence work, the first step is to gather data.

  Our scraper service is designed to pick up data from arbitrary sources, as long as the format is returned as:
  ```bash
  URL | Headline | Paragraphs | Source
  ```
  Your sourcing script should be in Python an can be anything. You can load data from an S3 Bucket or design a cusotm scraping script.
  The current scraper-container is equipped with most tools you would need: 
  - Selenium 
  - BeautifulSoup 
  - Playwright

## Update: SSARE Release
<Note>
[SSARE - (Semantic Search Article Recommendation Engine)](https://github.com/open-politics/SSARE)
</Note>
> SSARE is Open Politics' data aggregation system and vector storage endpoint. It aims to create up-to-date and relevant datasets for the LLMs to work with. 

> A microservice infrastructure continuously scrapes news sites and stores them in a vector storage and a relational database (Postgres). Sources can be added with Python scripts which yield a dataframe with: URL | Headline | Paragraphs | Source. Just clone the service, add your scripts and bring your own data endpoint into production.

        **The Django stack is now replaced by a FastAPI backend + NextJS Frontend.**  
        The stack setup & is largely based on Tiangolo's Fullstack Template. 
        Security and configuration updates will be fetched from the template.

        The frontend is now a Next.js app using shadcn as a UI library, amcharts for the globe and axios data fatches to the backend. The roadmap foresees that Open Politics will provide a unified interface for data resource management.
