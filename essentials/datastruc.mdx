## Pydantic Data Models

This document provides an overview of the Pydantic data models used in our project. These models are essential for defining the structure of our data and ensuring data validation.

<Note>
If you want to boot up the system and insert a new feature, flag or classification: the "Tag" model is mostly unused as of now. 
</Note> 

### BaseDoc

The `BaseDoc` model is the base class for all documents in our system. It includes common fields such as `url`, `headline`, `paragraphs`, `source`.
This means any data that you can translate into that format can be inserted. 
More metadata fields and classes can be discussed for following versions.

```python
class BaseDoc(BaseModel):
    url: str
    headline: str
    paragraphs: str
    source: str
```

It is the base component for the ingestion via the [Scraper Service](/essentials/scraper).
