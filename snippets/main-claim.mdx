# Main Claim

Turn analytical methods into shareable schemas. Apply them at scale.

**Core Innovation:** Domain expertise in natural language creates analysis systems. Define what you want to extract in plain English. AI applies it across documents. Enables qualitative research at scale.

**Why This Exists:** Political scientists needed tools outside well funded institutions. Domain expertise in natural language is enough. Works for bureaucrats, NGOs, journalists, citisens. Same infrastructure analyses speeches and processes forms.

This universality makes it public infrastructure-like libraries, analysis tools shouldn't be locked away.
