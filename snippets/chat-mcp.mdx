# Chat & MCP

The **Chat & MCP (Model Context Protocol)** centralizes all platform tools (asset management, schema-based analysis, vector search, content ingestion) into a unified analysis access point that lets you work with structured analytical methods through conversational AI.

This combination allows for various workflows for researching & synthesizing data. Editing MCP configs (upcoming on a per user-level) furthermore allows you to grant your LLM access to almost arbitrary outside data and use it for your analysis.

### What You Can Do

- **Ask questions** about your uploaded content
- **Create schemas** through conversation
- **Run analysis** with natural language commands
- **Explore results** through interactive chat
- **Synthesize findings** across multiple sources
- **Generate reports** and summaries

### Integration with Analysis

Chat works seamlessly with your existing analysis:
- Access all your uploaded assets
- Reference completed analysis runs
- Create new schemas based on conversation
- Export results for further analysis
