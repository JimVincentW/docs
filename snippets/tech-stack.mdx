# Tech Stack

The platform is built from several independent services that work together. You can run them all locally or mix local and managed services.

### Core Components

| Component | What It Does | Technology |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Backend** | API, analysis jobs, MCP server | FastAPI + Python |
| **Frontend** | Web interface | Next.js + React |
| **Worker** | Background processing for large jobs | Celery |
| **Database** | Data storage with vector search | PostgreSQL + PGVector |
| **Object Storage** | File storage for uploads | MinIO (S3-compatible) |
| **Cache/Queue** | Session management, job queues | Redis |
| **Geocoding** | Location extraction and mapping | Pelias |
| **LLM** (optional) | Local AI inference | Ollama |

### Deployment Flexibility

  <Card title="Fully Local" icon="shield">
    Run everything on your own hardware. Good for air-gapped environments or complete data control.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hybrid" icon="cloud">
    Run the application locally but use managed services (AWS RDS, Upstash Redis, S3) to reduce operational burden.
