<Note>
  This documentation is work in progress. Technically each microservice has it's own openapi doc, we yet need to automate this.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
